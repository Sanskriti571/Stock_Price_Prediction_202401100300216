#  Stock Price Prediction using Random Forest Regressor

This project builds a regression-based model to **predict next-day stock closing prices** using historical stock market data. It uses the first 7 CSV datasets from a ZIP archive of stock data, applies feature engineering, trains a `RandomForestRegressor`, evaluates its performance using multiple metrics, and visualizes the results.

##  How to Run

### In Google Colab:

1. Upload the ZIP file:
   ```python
   from google.colab import files
   uploaded = files.upload()  # Upload `archive (2).zip`
Update the path in the notebook:

python
Copy
Edit
zip_path = "/content/archive (2).zip"
extract_dir = "stock_data"
Run all cells in stock_prediction.ipynb.

The notebook will:

Extract stock datasets

Use the first 7 CSV files

Train a Random Forest Regressor on each

Predict the next-day closing price

Evaluate and visualize model performance

 Evaluation Metrics
For each stock dataset, the following metrics are computed:

Metric	Description
RMSE	Root Mean Squared Error
MAE	Mean Absolute Error
R² Score	Coefficient of determination
Directional Accuracy	% of times predicted direction matched actual
Tolerance Accuracy	% predictions within ±2% of actual value

Each dataset's actual vs. predicted price is plotted along with bar charts for all metrics.

 Visualizations
Line plots: Actual vs Predicted Closing Prices

Bar plots: RMSE, MAE, R² Score, Directional Accuracy, and Tolerance Accuracy per stock

 Future Improvements
Use technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD)

Add news sentiment analysis

Test deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, GRU)

Compare with other regressors (e.g., XGBoost, SVR)
